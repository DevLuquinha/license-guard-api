# License Management Systems – Concepts

Author: Lucas Emmanuel Rodrigues Firmino de Paula
Date: 19/01/2026
Summary: This document describes essential software license management concepts to support architectural decisions for the LicenseGuard API.

### Guiding Question: 
"Why does LicenseGuard use online validation, license keys, and device-based licensing, and why does it NOT use advanced fingerprinting or offline licensing?"

### Purpose of the Document
This document focuses on conceptual understanding and architectural reasoning. It does not define implementation details or technical solutions.

### Analyzed Licensing Models

### Model Chosen for LicenseGuard MVP

### Reasons for the Chosen Model

### Discarded Approaches and Reasons

### Study checklist:
[ ] What is a license management system?  
- Why licensing is not absolute security?

[ ] Common Licensing Types
- Simple License Key
- Online validation (license server)
- Node-locked (specific machine)
- Device-based (by identifier)
- Floating licenses (just concept)
- Offline vs online validation

[ ] I should be able to answer: "Why LicenseGuard MVP uses online validation + device-based?"

[ ] Devices identifiers (concepts)
- What is typically used as "device id"?

- pros and cons of:
    - GUID generated by the application
    - Simple hash
    - Advanced fingerprint (why it not use now)
    - Why the backend should not fully trust the client

[ ] Expiration and Revocation
- Difference between:
    - Auto Expiration
    - Manual Revocation
- Why revogation is domain rule, not just a technical detail
- What happens when:
    - License expires
    - License revoked
    - Device changes

[ ] License Validation (Logic Flow)
- Input:
    - License key
    - Device id
- Decision:
    - Exists?
    - Is active?
    - Is expired?
    - Is revoked?
    - Authorized device?
- Output:
    - Valid or Not Valid
    - Reason
